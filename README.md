# 1. Ediwaves Website
## 1.1 About
Ediwaves is a profesional orientation company focused in finding the best future for a teenager who doesn't know about his carreer and skills. <br>
Elsa Ennes is the director and CEO of Ediwaves.
<br>
## 1.2 Development
This site was developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch,without any frameworks. ( Just a little bootstrap 5 ). <br>
I made this website when I was starting my carreer in Computer Science, I was still in school, so for a 16 years old programmer, this website is well developed. <br>
This was my first website and every single line of code was written by me, without any copy & paste from the internet, even the design and media was created by <strong>Pedro Camargo</strong>. <br>
This website is 100% responsive, with a hamburger menu for mobile devices (the hamburger menu was built without any frameworks too, I know, a little messy but the final result was incredible xD). <br>
